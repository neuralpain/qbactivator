# qbactivator

Activation script for QuickBooks Point Of Sale Software on Windows.

> **Note**  
This activator **requires** PowerShell 4.0 or later to be installed on your Windows machine in order to function as intended.

### A few things before you start

- There is no need for you to run the insatller manually or enter any keys into the installer. The script will take care of that part for you. All you need to do is move your mouse and click the "Next" and "Finish" buttons. Do not launch QuickBooks after installation. Uncheck the "Launch QuickBooks" box before you click Finish.

- Normally, it's recommended to avoid installing updates through the application because there's a high chance that it will be blocked in the future; but I haven't had any issues when testing with **MANUAL** updates downloaded from Intuit.

- QuickBooks is installed as Pro Multistore only. There is no support for Basic (except on POSv11) or Pro level (because why would you even want that).

> **Warning**  
> This activator was designed to work with only a single version of QuickBooks POS installed. If there are multiple versions, it will use the most recent version of the software, and that may cause unexpected results. Caution is advised. Uninstall all previous versions of QuickBooks POS.

## The Setup (with installation)

Extract `qbactivator.cmd` and `qbpatch.dat` to the **same folder** containing the QuickBooks installer (if any). This is the main requirement. When the script is started it will look in the current location for `qbpatch.dat`. If it is not found, the activator will terminate.

Ensure that the QuickBooks installer executable has the original name from the download, e.g., `QuickBooksPOSV19.exe`, `QuickBooksPOSV12.exe` etc. If the name has changed, the installer will not be recognized by the activator.

> **Note**  
> By default, the activator will search for the installer executable and assumes that you will be installing and activating QuickBooks all at once, however, it is not a requirement for the script to continue. Without an executable present, the script assumes an `activation-only` request and ignores installation.

## Instructions for activation

   you continue.
