# qbactivator

Activation script for QuickBooks Point Of Sale Software on Windows.

### A few things before you start

- There is no need for you to run the insatller manually or enter any keys into the installer. The script will take care of that part for you. All you need to do is click "Next" and "Finish".

- If installing QuickBooks for the first time, do not launch QuickBooks after installation. Uncheck the "Launch QuickBooks" box and click Finish.

- Normally, it's recommended to avoid installing updates through the application because it will probably be blocked in the future; but I've never had any issues when testing with **MANUAL** updates downloaded from Intuit.

- To upgrade to Multistore if you have already activated it, jump to step 24.

> **Warning**  
> This activator was designed to work with only one version of QuickBooks installed. If there are multiple versions, it will use the most recent version of the software.

## The Setup

Extract `qbactivator.cmd` and `qbpatch.dat` to the **same folder** containing the QuickBooks installer (if any). This is the main requirement. When the script is started it will look in the current location for `qbpatch.dat`. If it is not found, the activator will terminate.

Ensure that the QuickBooks installer executable has the original name from the download, e.g., `QuickBooksPOSV19.exe`, `QuickBooksPOSV12.exe` etc. If the name has changed, the installer will not be recognized by the activator.

> **Note**  
> By default, the activator will also search for the installer executable and assumes that you will be installing and activating QuickBooks all at once, however it is not a requirement for the script to continue. Without an executable present, the script assumes an `activation-only` request and ignores installation.

## Instructions for Activation
