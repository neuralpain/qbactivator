# qbactivator - Simplified README v1.5

For more information, visit <https://github.com/neuralpain/qbactivator>

Activation script for QuickBooks Point Of Sale Software on Windows.

> **Warning**  
> `qbactivator` was designed to work with only a single version of
> QuickBooks POS installed. If there are multiple versions installed,
> the activator will throw an error, otherwise, unexpected results
> may occur. Uninstall all other versions of QuickBooks POS before
> running this activator.

> **Note**  
> By default, the activator will search for the installer executable 
> and assumes that you will be installing and activating QuickBooks all 
> at once, however, it is not a requirement for the script to continue. 
> Without an executable present, the script assumes an `activation-only` 
> request and ignores installation.
