qbactivator | Simplified README v2.3

Activation script for QuickBooks Point Of Sale Software on Windows.

To view the full documentation for this activation script, visit
<https://github.com/neuralpain/qbactivator>

!!! An internet connection is required.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "qbactivator" was designed to work with only a single version of    |
| QuickBooks POS installed. If there are multiple versions installed, |
| the activator may throw an error. Ensure to remove all other        |
| versions of QuickBooks POS before running this activator.           |
+=====================================================================+
| By default, the activator will search for the installer executable  |
| first and assumes that you will be installing and activating        |
| QuickBooks all at once. However, it is not a requirement for the    |
| script to continue: without an installer present, the script        |
| assumes an "activation-only" request and ignores installation.      |
