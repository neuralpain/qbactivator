!!! An internet connection is required.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| "qbactivator" was designed to work with only a single version of    |
| QuickBooks POS installed. If there are multiple versions installed, |
| the activator will throw an error, otherwise, unexpected results    |
| may occur. Uninstall all other versions of QuickBooks POS before    |
| running this activator.                                             |
+=====================================================================+
| By default, the activator will search for the installer executable  |
| and assumes that you will be installing and activating QuickBooks   |
| all at once, however, it is not a requirement for the script to     |
| continue. Without an installer present, the script assumes an       |
| "activation-only" request and ignores installation.                 |
