# [qbactivator](https://github.com/neuralpain/qbactivator) - Minified README v1.4

### A few things before you start

- If installing QuickBooks for the first time, do not launch QuickBooks after 
installation. Uncheck the "Launch QuickBooks" box and click Finish.

- Normally, it's recommended to avoid installing updates through the application 
because it will probably be blocked in the future; but I've never had any issues when 
testing with **MANUAL** updates downloaded from Intuit.

- To upgrade to Multistore if you have already activated it, jump to step 24.

> **Warning**  
> This activator was designed to work with only one version of QuickBooks installed.
> If there are multiple versions, it will use the most recent version of the software.

## The Setup

Extract `qbactivator.cmd` and `qbpatch.dat` to the **same folder** containing the 
QuickBooks installer (if any) and ensure that the QuickBooks installer executable has 
the original name from the download. If the name has changed, the installer will not 
be recognized by the activator.

By default, the activator assumes that you will be installing and activating 
QuickBooks all at once. Without an executable present, the script assumes an 
`activation-only` request and ignores installation.

## Instructions for activation

1. Ensure that a QuickBooks software is installed before you continue
2. Open the installed QuickBooks software. You will be prompted about the
   need for Administrator access
